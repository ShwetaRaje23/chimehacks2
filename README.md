Core idea:  Aid safety in developing countries and provide a method to ask for help from a potentially dangerous situation -> disguising calls for help under a fun joke/meme/image messaging service

Enable people to safely exit a situation(i.e. domestic violence) or ask for help in a humorously disguised manner.
